 Note for CAMapView developers:
 Every algorithm has to be a class method which returns an array of CAAnnotations or a subclass of it. 
 OR for future releases
 They can be instance methods if they run asynchronously. The instance holder needs to implement the delegate protCAol and the method needs to call the delegate.
